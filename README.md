## 📌 **Introduction**  

Student well-being is a critical factor in **academic performance, personal development, and overall quality of life**. In today’s fast-paced educational environment, students face immense pressure that affects their mental, emotional, and physical health. This project analyzes three key factors:  

- **Depression** 😞: A growing concern among students, affecting motivation, concentration, and academic success.  
- **Financial Stress** 💰: Managing tuition fees, rent, and living expenses can be overwhelming, leading to anxiety and reduced academic performance.  
- **Sleep Deprivation** 💤: Long study hours, academic pressure, and part-time jobs contribute to poor sleep habits, affecting cognitive function and retention.  

By understanding these relationships, **institutions can take steps to enhance student support services, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.**
